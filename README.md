# ABCFeatureSelector
Optimization framework for feature selection in Python source code quality assessment. Using nature-inspired Modified Discrete Artificial Bee Colony (MDisABC) algorithm and meta-analysis, it efficiently reduces dimensionality while preserving important relationships. The project applies optimization techniques to select minimal yet effective sets of code metrics.
